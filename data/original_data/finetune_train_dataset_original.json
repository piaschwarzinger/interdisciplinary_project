    "output": "A man is seated at a table with some tools, where his upper arm is positioned moderately above shoulder level, increasing strain on the shoulder joint. His neck is side-bent, leading to muscle imbalance and fatigue, while his trunk is bent forward between 20 and 60 degrees, causing increased spinal loading. Furthermore, his lower arm appears too extended or overly flexed, which can result in fatigue if maintained for prolonged periods. Additionally, he is standing on one leg, creating an asymmetric load on the lower body."
