Risk factors: too extended or overly flexed (fatigue if sustained).\nBody part: forearm right. Risk factors: too extended or overly flexed (fatigue if sustained).\nBody part: neck. Risk factors: strongly flexed (causing significant muscular load), with rotated (leading to torsional strain); side-bent (causing muscle imbalance; fatigue).\nBody part: trunk. Risk factors: bent forward 20 to 60 degrees (causing increased spinal loading), with tilted sideways (leading to muscle imbalance; fatigue).",
    "output": "Seated at a table, the man appears to be focused on a task involving fine motor skills. His right upper arm stays elevated above shoulder level at times, placing stress on the joint. Meanwhile, both forearms adopt non-neutral positions, either overextended or overly flexed, suggesting muscular tension from sustained or precise hand activity."
