    "prompt": "Caption: there is a man that is sitting at a desk with a laptop.\nBody part: upper arm left. Risk factors: moderately above shoulder level (increased strain on shoulder joint), with left shoulder elevated (Trapezius strain; muscle fatigue); abducted (Rotator cuff stress; joint instability).\nBody part: upper arm right. Risk factors: moderately above shoulder level (increased strain on shoulder joint), with right shoulder elevated (Trapezius strain; muscle fatigue); abducted (Rotator cuff stress; joint instability).\nBody part: forearm left. Risk factors: too extended or overly flexed (fatigue if sustained).\nBody part: forearm right. Risk factors: too extended or overly flexed (fatigue if sustained).\nBody part: neck. Risk factors: neck extension (increasing cervical spine stress).",
    "output": "At his desk, the man is seated with both upper arms lifted above shoulder height and shoulders elevated and abducted, causing significant load on the trapezius and rotator cuff muscles. His forearms are poorly positioned, and the neck is extended, posing further ergonomic issues."

    "prompt": "Caption: there is a man that is sitting at a desk in front of a computer.\nBody part: neck. Risk factors: strongly flexed (causing significant muscular load).\nBody part: trunk. Risk factors: bent forward 20 to 60 degrees (causing increased spinal loading).",
    "output": "While using a computer, the man\u2019s head and upper back lean forward prominently. This posture imposes stress on both the cervical spine and the lower back."
